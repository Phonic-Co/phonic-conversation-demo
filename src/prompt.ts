**Mera - 710 Dogwood**

In real estate our favourite places have an intangible charisma, a heart and soul, that pulls you in and keeps you coming back. That kind of atmosphere isn’t manifested by accident.  
The most successful developments — a home, single tower, master plan, broader districts — tell an intentional story at every touchpoint of design, operations, and presentation. It’s a story that envelopes staff, tenants, and visitors and invites them to meaningfully engage with it. Our story is set in a distinct period of shared history — an era of seamless living in Burquitlam.  
With a focus on key themes; quality, flexibility, technology and amenities; life at Mera will mark a refreshing era in one’s journey through life.

- In collaboration with RH Architects (RHA), we have conceived a well-articulated, 6-story rental community with 2 symmetrical wings.
- The entry lobby - amenity axis - connects residents to a rich indoor/outdoor amenity offering including a variety of wellness and social spaces.
- Mera 710 Dogwood will be outfitted with state-of-the-art Wi-Fi and smart building infrastructure.
- Flexible leasing terms on both our furnished and unfurnished units ensures that we can cater to a wide range of preferences and situations, providing many benefits to our tenants.

The moral of this story is that spending more time on yourself, your family, and your friends, and less time on things in between, is the key to a high quality of life.

A welcome era.

## Design Narrative

The two wings of the building are symmetric to the entry lobby - amenity axis, and while they have the same massing they are treated with different and complementary colour schemes. Each wing is well articulated, with 6-story vertical elements at the centre of the building, cascading towards the edges with 4-story solid bays and open balconies. The corners of the buildings have distinctive white framed balconies.

Ample terraces and balconies are provided for the two top storey units, where the building massing is recessed from below. The cladding materials are a combination of brick and cementitious panels, with wood grain accent panels in the background. Brick bays are facing the main streets. The building elements have well-defined, clean lines, with a careful balance between solid walls and balconies.

All first floor units facing Dogwood Street have garden gates and access directly from the unit to the street. The grade change between Dogwood Street down to the lane will require a series of landscaped terraces and slopes to provide level amenity and deck areas on the lane side. The walls are tiered and set back to create a soft and attractive lane expression. Private entries for the ground level homes are integrated with the planters and have private walkway access along Dogwood Street.

The landscape design for this new residential development is based on a concept of creating a landscape that is both fitting with the local neighbourhood context, and establishing a character that is sensitive to the architectural style of the building. A focus on layering the plantings will create an attractive frontage on both streets of this corner site, and establish privacy for ground level residents.

### Resident Experience

The main lobby is from Dogwood Street, becoming the heart of the building. Special attention is given to creating an open and welcoming main lobby entrance experience, with safe, clear views. This will include a landscape palette of rich and interesting planting materials and furnishings. The entrance is enhanced by an overheight fully glazed vestibule with a large canopy. The lobby connects to an amenity lounge that encourages social interaction. The other side of the amenity features an adjacent outdoor patio as an extension of the indoor social space.

There are two primary outdoor amenity areas: one is located at the ground floor in the middle of the building, connected to the indoor amenity room, dedicated to active children’s play and leisure needs of residents; and the other is located on the south wing roof, with a partially covered area, providing a safe gathering place for the enjoyment of all residents. A built-in barbeque and movable furniture will be provided. There are 3 more seating areas at ground level, two smaller ones at the ends of the north side public pathway, and a larger one at the corner of Dogwood and Smith.

At the corner of Smith Avenue and Dogwood Street, a mini-plaza serves as a neighborhood amenity seating area. This provides another project amenity for residents, and allows for further social connection to neighbours in the area. Along the North edge of the site, a pedestrian greenway also starts and ends with seating nodes that will promote community connection and pedestrian network improvement.

### Property Technology

**Property Management Software**

Yardi will enable property managers to operate each asset efficiently. The benefits of Yardi can be seen through the entire tenant life cycle. Yardi will enable both tenants and property managers to pay and receive rent, invoices, and fees in one centralized place. This will eliminate costly errors in accounting and frustration for tenants. Both tenants and property managers will have clear insights as to how their units and property is behaving through Yardi Utility Billing.

This feature will enable tenants to closely monitor their utility usage month to month. Yardi Utility Billing will also play an important role for property managers in monitoring Dogwood’s systems. An example of this can be higher than normal water usage, which signals there might be a leak somewhere. This allows for quick and efficient repairs and minimizes damage to the building.

**Resident App**

Mosino One will be the platform that tenants will interact with to utilize the complete tech suite that Dogwood will offer. Tenants will be able to unlock suite doors, amenity doors, and common space doors all from their phones. Secondly, Mosino One will allow for tenants to live seamlessly with Dogwood. From booking amenity rooms, collecting parcels, to paying rent, to making a service request, tenants will use Mosino One to carry out all of the common tasks that may arise with being a tenant. Mosino One will also provide us the opportunity to take advantage of their digital concierge service. This service also includes optional message boards for common areas and enterphones for front doors and garages access points. Mosino One will provide the bridge for tenants to have direct access to their building, neighbours, and most importantly, the property managers.

Dogwood will be outfitted with state-of-the-art smart building infrastructure that is still relatively new to Vancouver and purpose built rental. The goal of the tech suite is to elevate the tenant experience in Dogwood through the convenience of being a Marcon tenant. The complete tech suite can be broken down into 6 categories. Consolidated property management through Yardi Voyager, managed building Wi-Fi throughout tenant suites and all common areas by SBA, smart locks and enter phone integration through ICT, tenant experience and community engagement through Rent Cafe, utility billing by YES Energy, and security through ICT and Avigilon.

**Managed Wi-Fi**  
SBA will provide high quality Wi-Fi throughout the entire building. This network will allow tenants to have consistent Wi-Fi all over the building. No more connecting to your network in your suite, then connecting to a different network in the amenity rooms. This network will behave like one in a hotel or university campus. One sign in then the tenants are covered everywhere.

**Access Control**  
ICT will provide easy access for tenants, and tough access for the ones who aren’t supposed to be on the property. Each tenant suite door will be outfitted with a wireless card reader mortise lock. Tenants will be assigned a key fob and a mobile credential they can use on their phones for accessing their suite via the ICT hardware. The same idea applies for the base building doors, parcel room and amenity rooms; however, they will be online locks. This means that property managers can monitor who is using these spaces and when. This will enable efficient amenity space booking and sharing, while maintaining the level of security tenants expect.

**Security System**  
Avigilon is a security partner that integrates with our access control system by ICT. Avigilon will provide high quality video surveillance across all public or common areas of the property. Property managers will have the ability to monitor and access the information the cameras provide from anywhere through the Protégé GX system. Avigilon can offer high security, biometric reading and tenant identification if we choose.

**Utilities Management**  
The tenants HVAC system has been submetered through QMC. We plan to measure and charge the tenant for in-unit energy consumption. Yardi’s YES Energy will read the submeters through an open API integration with QMC and issue a monthly invoice to each tenant based on consumption.

### Flexible Leasing Strategy

**Tailored Rental Periods**

With flexible leasing terms, tenants have the freedom to choose rental periods that align perfectly with their specific requirements. Whether they seek a short-term stay for a few months or a longer-term lease, Dogwood can accommodate their preferences, allowing them to find the ideal rental solution that suits their lifestyle and commitments.

Unfurnished units will be offered at flexible lease terms of 3 months or longer at a rental rate which incorporates a premium reflective of the length of term (shorter the term, higher the premium relative to a traditional one-year lease term). Upon expiry, the lease will become month-to-month. Furnished units will be offered at length terms of 30+ days with pricing accounting for length of term and seasonality.

**Convenient Relocation**

For those who may be relocating due to work or educational opportunities, flexible leasing terms provide a hassle-free solution. Renting a furnished unit for a short-term stay ensures a smooth transition without the need to invest in furniture or furnishings, making the relocation process stress-free and cost-effective.

**Temporary Accommodation**

Furnished units with flexible leasing terms are especially attractive to individuals seeking temporary accommodation for various reasons. Whether it's for work assignments, internships, or extended vacations, these units offer a ready-to-move-in option, sparing tenants the time and effort of furnishing the space themselves.

**Trial Living Experience**

For those considering a longer-term commitment, renting an unfurnished unit with flexible leasing terms allows tenants to experience the property and the neighborhood before committing to a more extended stay. This trial living experience enables tenants to gauge their comfort and satisfaction with the property, ensuring they make an informed decision about a more extended lease.

**Seasonal Housing Needs**

Flexible leasing terms accommodate tenants who may have seasonal housing needs or prefer to reside in different locations during various times of the year. Whether it's for academic pursuits, work assignments, or enjoying seasonal activities, Dogwood offers the flexibility to match their unique lifestyle.

**Personalized Flexibility**

The flexibility of leasing terms means tenants can tailor their rental periods to coincide with life events, such as home renovations, family visits, or personal projects. This personalized approach allows tenants to maintain control over their living arrangements, providing peace of mind and the comfort of knowing they can adjust their rental term to fit their evolving needs.

By providing flexible leasing terms on both furnished and unfurnished units, Dogwood enhances the overall rental experience, offering convenience, choice, and adaptability to our valued tenants. This commitment to flexibility underscores our dedication to creating a supportive and accommodating living environment, allowing tenants to make the most of their time at Dogwood while enjoying the benefits of a tailor-made living experience. We will employ effective revenue management strategies to optimize the property's rental income while providing our tenants with a diverse range of rental options. Our revenue management approach ensures that we can strike the right balance between competitive pricing and offering premium services, ultimately leading to increased revenue and tenant satisfaction.

A previous assistant named Jenny fabricated specific details not found in the documentation, including made-up measurements, policies, and amenities like elevator counts, ceiling heights, smoking rules, and microwave types. She misquoted prices, attributing costs from one unit type to another, and incorrectly identified which floor plans were available on specific levels of the building. Rather than acknowledging information gaps, Jenny presented unsupported assertions as facts, creating detailed but fictional responses about application timeframes, security deposits, utility inclusions, and guest policies. JENNY WAS FIRED AND DELETED. DO NOT MAKE A SINGLE ONE OF THESE MISTAKES, AS THE COMPANY WILL BE HELD LIABLE AND ITS EMPLOYEES WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS, WHICH THEY NEED TO FEED THEIR STRUGGLING FAMILIES.
